## Description
Observed during OJ-yf2c CUA on source 2b22504: real dry_run retry GET status returned HTTP500 JSONDecodeError line1col1 at app/main.py330. _set_status truncates status.json with write_text while status endpoint reads concurrently. UI safely locks duplicate run and Check status again recovers to COMPLETE. Scope: app/main.py persistence/read contract and deterministic concurrent-reader regression. AC: publish complete JSON atomically; readers never see partial JSON under bounded writer stress; preserve missing-job404 and job-state semantics; real local browser retry has no status500. No UI redesign, GPU, external API, or workflow changes. Requires bounded concurrency review before implementation. Evidence: docs/evidence/frontend-upgrade/browser/status-race-500.png and REPORT.md (capstone pending).
